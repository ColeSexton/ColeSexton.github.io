  <h2>A Little About Me:</h2>
  <p>
    I am a musician, audio engineer, and software developer. <br />
    I have experience developing front-end applications using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. <br />
    I also work with Java and MySQL for back-end development and database management. <br />
    I am skilled in Logic Pro X and Pro Tools for creating, mixing, and mastering music. <br />
    I’m a dedicated sound engineer with experience mixing all types of live events, including rock/pop concerts, 
    orchestras, corporate speaking engagements, and any event requiring sound reinforcement. <br />
    I’m well-versed in industry-standard mixing consoles from Avid, Allen & Heath, Yamaha, and Midas. <br />
    My goal is to use my knowledge and passion to create innovative music software and bridge the gap between creators and their audiences. <br />
    I love to learn, and I value integrity and honesty above all. <br />
